<h1 class="title">Crunchy Greens With Carrot-Ginger Dressing</h1>

<img src="greenscarrotginger.jpg">

<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This recipe draws inspiration from the sunny-orange flavor of green salads 
    with carrot-ginger dressing at Japanese American restaurants. The pulpy, aromatic 
    dressing may be the star, but a salad is only as good as its lettuce. After 
    washing and thoroughly spin-drying the greens in a salad spinner (alternatively, 
    you can pat them dry in a clean kitchen towel), one way to maximize their crunch 
    before adding the dressing is to refrigerate them, covered, for at least 30 minutes. 
    Little Gem has a sweet, juicy sturdiness, but regular packaged mixed greens, baby 
    spinach and chopped romaine hearts work, too.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 small carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>2 to 4 heads Little Gem lettuce</li>
    <li>1 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Make the dressing: In a food processor, puree the carrot, ginger, olive oil, 
        rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, onion powder, a pinch of salt and 1 tablespoon 
        cold water until as smooth as possible, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Dress the salad: Place the lettuce leaves in a large serving bowl. Add a couple 
        of tablespoons of the dressing and toss, then add more as needed to evenly coat. 
        The salad should be lightly dressed, not drowned; don't use every drop of dressing 
        if you don't need to. Taste for seasoning, adjusting with more salt as desired. Top 
        the salad with the mint leaves and serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>
