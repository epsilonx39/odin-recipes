<h1 class="title">Chicken Breasts with Lemon</h1>

<img src="chickenlemon.jpg">

<h2>Description</h2>
 
  <p>In this recipe, which Pierre Franey brought to The Times in 1992 
    in one of his 60-Minute Gourmet columns, two teaspoons of lemon zest 
    are added to a simple sauce of lemon juice, thyme, garlic and shallots. 
    It is, at once, lively and elegant. To round it out, it needs a sturdy 
    accompaniment. Mr. Franey suggested mashed potatoes with garlic and basil, 
    with just a little olive oil swirled in.</p>
    
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>4 skinless boneless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
    <li>tablespoons finely chopped shallots</li> 
    <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Season flour with salt and pepper, and dredge the chicken all over. 
        Remove the excess flour.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large enough to hold the chicken 
        pieces in one layer. Add chicken and cook, uncovered, over medium heat 
        for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.</li>
    <li>Flip the chicken and cook for 5 minutes more, or until cooked through. 
        Carefully remove the oil from the skillet, leaving the chicken. Discard 
        the oil.</li>
    <li>Add the thyme, shallots and garlic, and cook for about a minute. Do not 
        burn the garlic. Add the lemon rind, the lemon juice and the broth.</li>
    <li>Scrape the skillet to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the bottom. 
        Add the butter, and cook for 3 minutes longer. Serve immediately.</li>
